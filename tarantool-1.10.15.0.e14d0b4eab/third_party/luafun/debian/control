Description: High-performance functional programming library for Lua
 Lua Fun provides a set of more than 50 programming primitives typically
 found in languages like Standard ML, Haskell, Erlang, JavaScript, Python and
 even Lisp. High-order functions such as map, filter, reduce, zip, etc.,
 make it easy to write simple and efficient functional code.
